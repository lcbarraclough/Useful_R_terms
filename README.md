# Useful_R_terms
This is a place to note useful R terminology. <br/>
setwd() -> set working directory. <br/>
getwd() -> get working directory. <br/>
head() -> displays the first few rows of your imported data set. <br/>
tail() -> displays the last few rows of your imported data set. <br/>
str() -> informs you whether the variables in your imported data set are continuous, integers, categorical or characters. <br/>
class() -> tells you what type of variable you're dealing with. <br/>
'==' -> tells R that the term must be exactly as you stipulated. <br/>
csv. -> comma seperated values and is the best form of data to use in R. 
function(x,y) -> allows you to create a function in R. The function arguments don't necessarily have to be x and y, they can be any letters or phrases. <br/>
for() -> allows us to create a loop that iterates through a number of items normally stored as a list. This function will be performed on each item equally on the list. <br/>
list() -> creates an empty list unless there is something in the brackets. <br/>
lapply() -> this is another loop function, where the first argument gives the list objecy to be iterated over whereas the second argument defines an unamed function. The apply loop is easier and faster to use than the for() loop. <br/>
sapply -> gives more readable outcomes from the lappy() loop. <br/>
ifelse() -> this is a conditional statement that tests for some logival TRUE/FALSE condition in the data. It can thern perform one of two actions depending on the outcome of the test. <br/>
